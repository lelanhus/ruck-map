## Feature Development Process

1. **Specification** (with feature-spec-writer):
   - Define user stories
   - Create acceptance criteria
   - Design data models
   - Plan UI/UX flow

2. **Implementation** (with appropriate expert):
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add necessary UI components
   - Integrate with existing systems

3. **Testing** (with swift-testing-expert):
   - Unit tests for logic
   - UI tests for interactions
   - Integration tests
   - Performance validation

4. **Polish** (with accessibility-expert):
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Haptic feedback
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases

## Sub-Agent Mapping

The command automatically selects the right expert:

```
route-* features     â†’ mapkit-expert
live-* features      â†’ activitykit-expert
unit-* features      â†’ swiftui-implementation-expert + swift-security-expert
workout-* features   â†’ healthkit-expert
watch-* features     â†’ watchos-expert
widget-* features    â†’ widgetkit-expert
ml-* features        â†’ coreml-expert
weather-* features   â†’ weatherkit-expert
chart-* features     â†’ swiftcharts-expert
```
