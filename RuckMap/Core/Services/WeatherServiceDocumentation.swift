 ## Weather Impact Analysis
 
 The service provides comprehensive weather impact analysis for rucking activities:
 
 ### Temperature Impact
 - **Beneficial**: 15-25°C (59-77°F)
 - **Neutral**: 5-15°C or 25-30°C (41-59°F or 77-86°F)
 - **Challenging**: 0-5°C or 30-35°C (32-41°F or 86-95°F)
 - **Dangerous**: <0°C or >35°C (<32°F or >95°F)
 
 ### Wind Impact
 - **Beneficial**: <10 m/s (22 mph)
 - **Neutral**: 10-15 m/s (22-34 mph)
 - **Challenging**: 15-20 m/s (34-45 mph)
 - **Dangerous**: >20 m/s (45 mph)
 
 ### Precipitation Impact
 - **Beneficial**: 0 mm/hr (no precipitation)
 - **Neutral**: 0-5 mm/hr (light rain)
 - **Challenging**: 5-15 mm/hr (moderate rain)
 - **Dangerous**: >15 mm/hr (heavy rain)
 
 ## Integration with CalorieCalculator
 
 The WeatherService seamlessly integrates with the CalorieCalculator to provide:
 
 - Real-time temperature adjustments for metabolic rate calculations
 - Wind resistance factors for energy expenditure
 - Humidity impact on perceived exertion
 - Weather-based safety recommendations
 
 ## Error Handling and Resilience
 
 ### API Error Handling
 - Graceful degradation when WeatherKit API is unavailable
 - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
 - Fallback to cached data when network fails
 - Rate limiting protection with cache optimization
 
 ### Location Errors
 - Validation of GPS coordinates before API calls
 - Fallback to nearest cached weather data
 - Default weather conditions when no data available
 
 ### Cache Management
 - Automatic cleanup of expired entries
 - Size-based cache eviction (oldest entries removed first)
 - Corruption detection and recovery
 
 ## Performance Characteristics
 
 ### Memory Usage
 - Typical cache size: 1-2 MB for 50 weather entries
 - Automatic cleanup prevents memory growth
 - WeakRef patterns prevent retain cycles
 
 ### Battery Impact
 - Target: <1% battery usage per hour in optimized mode
 - Background tasks limited to essential updates
 - Intelligent update scheduling based on movement
 
 ### Network Usage
 - API calls limited to 500/day (WeatherKit free tier)
 - Cache hit rate typically >80% after initial use
 - Minimal data transfer per API call (~1-2 KB)
 
 ## Security and Privacy
 
 ### WeatherKit Authentication
 - JWT tokens managed by WeatherKit framework
 - No manual token management required
 - Automatic token refresh and validation
 
 ### Location Privacy
 - Weather coordinates rounded to ~100m precision for caching
 - No location data stored permanently
 - Cache cleared on app uninstall
 
 ## Usage Examples
 
 ### Basic Usage
 ```swift
 let weatherService = WeatherService()
 let location = CLLocation(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194)
 
 // Start weather updates for rucking session
 weatherService.startWeatherUpdates(for: location)
 
 // Get current weather conditions
 let conditions = try await weatherService.getCurrentWeather(for: location)
 
 // Analyze weather impact
 let impact = weatherService.getWeatherImpactAnalysis()
 ```
 
 ### Integration with LocationTrackingManager
 ```swift
 // Weather updates are automatically managed by LocationTrackingManager
 locationManager.startTracking(with: session)
 
 // Access weather data
 let currentWeather = locationManager.currentWeatherConditions
 let alerts = locationManager.weatherAlerts
 let impact = locationManager.getWeatherImpactAnalysis()
 ```
 
 ### Battery Optimization
 ```swift
 // Set battery optimization level
 weatherService.setBatteryOptimization(.maximum)
 
 // Or through LocationTrackingManager
 locationManager.setWeatherBatteryOptimization(.balanced)
 ```
