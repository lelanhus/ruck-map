 # Military-Grade LCDA Calorie Calculation Implementation
 
 ## Overview
 
 This documentation describes the implementation of the Load Carriage Decision Aid (LCDA) algorithm
 for military-grade calorie calculation in the RuckMap iOS application. The LCDA algorithm is used
 by the US Army for predicting energy expenditure during load carriage operations.
 
 ## Algorithm Foundation
 
 ### Core LCDA Equation
 The base metabolic rate calculation uses the LCDA walking equation:
 
 ```
 E = (1.44 + 1.94S + 0.24S²) × BW
 ```
 
 Where:
 - E = Energy expenditure (watts)
 - S = Speed (mph)
 - BW = Total body weight including load (kg)
 
 ### Speed Range
 - Minimum: 0.5 mph (0.22 m/s)
 - Maximum: 6.0 mph (2.68 m/s)
 - Optimal range: 2-4 mph for load carriage operations
 
 ### Accuracy
 - Target: ±10% accuracy as per military specifications
 - Confidence intervals provided with each calculation
 - Validated against published research data
 
 ## Environmental Adjustments
 
 ### Grade Multipliers
 Based on military load carriage research:
 
 | Grade (%) | Multiplier | Description |
 |-----------|------------|-------------|
 | -20%      | 0.85       | Steep downhill (eccentric loading) |
 | -10%      | 0.92       | Moderate downhill |
 | 0%        | 1.00       | Level terrain (baseline) |
 | +10%      | 1.45       | Moderate uphill |
 | +20%      | 2.10       | Steep uphill |
 
 Grade adjustments use smooth interpolation between discrete values.
 
 ### Temperature Factors
 Temperature stress adjustments:
 
 | Temperature (°C) | Factor | Rationale |
 |------------------|--------|-----------|
 | < -5°C          | 1.15   | Cold stress, increased metabolism |
 | -5 to 5°C       | 1.05   | Mild cold stress |
 | 5 to 25°C       | 1.00   | Optimal temperature range |
 | 25 to 30°C      | 1.05   | Mild heat stress |
 | > 30°C          | 1.15   | Heat stress, cooling costs |
 
 ### Altitude Adjustment
 - 10% VO₂max reduction per 1000m elevation gain
 - Applied as multiplicative factor: 1.0 + (altitude_km × 0.10)
 - Based on physiological altitude adaptation studies
 
 ### Wind Resistance
 Wind factor adjustments:
 
 | Wind Speed (m/s) | Factor | Description |
 |------------------|--------|-------------|
 | 0-5              | 1.00   | Minimal wind effect |
 | 5-10             | 1.05   | Light wind resistance |
 | 10-15            | 1.10   | Moderate wind resistance |
 | > 15             | 1.20   | Strong wind resistance |
 
 ## Terrain Multipliers
 
 Based on published military research on terrain difficulty:
 
 ```swift
 enum TerrainDifficultyMultiplier: Double {
     case pavement = 1.0   // Baseline
     case trail = 1.2      // 20% increase
     case gravel = 1.3     // 30% increase
     case sand = 1.8       // 80% increase
     case mud = 1.8        // 80% increase
     case snow = 1.5       // 50% increase
     case grass = 1.2      // 20% increase
     case stairs = 1.8     // 80% increase
 }
 ```
 
 ## Swift 6 Concurrency Implementation
 
 ### Actor Pattern
 The CalorieCalculator uses @MainActor to ensure thread safety:
 - All UI updates occur on main thread
 - Published properties are safely observable
 - No data races in concurrent access
 
 ### Async/Await Pattern
 ```swift
 func calculateCalories(with parameters: CalorieCalculationParameters) async throws -> CalorieCalculationResult
 ```
 
 ### Structured Concurrency
 Continuous calculation uses structured concurrency:
 ```swift
 func startContinuousCalculation(
     bodyWeight: Double,
     loadWeight: Double,
     locationProvider: @escaping () async -> (location: CLLocation?, grade: Double?, terrain: TerrainType?),
     weatherProvider: @escaping () async -> WeatherConditions?
 )
 ```
 
 ### Sendable Protocol
 All data structures implement Sendable for safe concurrent access:
 - CalorieCalculationParameters: Sendable
 - CalorieCalculationResult: Sendable
 - CalorieCalculationError: Sendable
 
 ## Real-time Operation
 
 ### Update Frequency
 - Calculations performed every 1 second
 - Optimized for battery efficiency
 - Automatic pause during stationary periods
 
 ### Data Integration
 - Location data from LocationTrackingManager
 - Grade data from ElevationFusionEngine
 - Weather data from WeatherConditions
 - Terrain data from TerrainSegments
 
 ### Performance Optimization
 - Efficient grade interpolation algorithm
 - Minimal memory allocation in hot path
 - Battery-aware calculation frequency
 - History management with configurable limits
 
 ## Validation and Testing
 
 ### Research Data Validation
 The implementation validates against known research data points:
 
 **Test Case 1**: 70kg person, 15kg load, 3 mph, level terrain
 - Expected: 4.5-5.5 kcal/min
 - Validates core LCDA equation accuracy
 
 **Test Case 2**: Grade adjustment validation
 - 10% grade should increase metabolic rate by ~45%
 - Validates grade multiplier implementation
 
 ### Unit Test Coverage
 - Algorithm accuracy tests
 - Input validation tests
 - Environmental factor tests
 - Terrain multiplier tests
 - Cumulative calorie tests
 - Thread safety tests
 - Performance benchmarks
 
 ## Error Handling
 
 ### Input Validation
 ```swift
 enum CalorieCalculationError: LocalizedError, Sendable {
     case invalidBodyWeight(Double)
     case invalidLoadWeight(Double)
     case invalidSpeed(Double)
     case invalidGrade(Double)
     case calculationOverflow
     case insufficientData
 }
 ```
 
 ### Graceful Degradation
 - Continue calculation despite temporary data unavailability
 - Use default values when environmental data missing
 - Maintain calculation history for trend analysis
 
 ## Integration Points
 
 ### LocationTrackingManager Integration
 ```swift
 // Automatic calorie tracking during sessions
 func startCalorieTracking(bodyWeight: Double, loadWeight: Double)
 
 // Real-time calorie data access
 var currentCalorieBurnRate: Double
 var totalCaloriesBurned: Double
 ```
 
 ### UI Integration
 - Real-time display in ActiveTrackingView
 - Historical data in session details
 - Confidence intervals for accuracy indication
 
 ### Data Persistence
 - Total calories stored in RuckSession
 - Calculation history available for analysis
 - Export support for external analysis tools
 
 ## Future Enhancements
 
 ### Machine Learning Personalization
 - Individual metabolic calibration
 - Adaptive algorithm parameters
 - Historical performance analysis
 
 ### Advanced Environmental Factors
 - Humidity adjustments
 - Air pressure variations
 - Clothing insulation factors
 
 ### Military Standards Compliance

 - US Army FM 21-18 alignment
 - International load carriage standards
