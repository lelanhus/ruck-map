## Key Swift Testing Features Used

### Test Organization
```swift
@Suite("Analytics Repository Tests")
struct AnalyticsRepositoryTests {
  // Test implementation
}
```

### Parameterized Testing
```swift
@Test("Analytics data filters by time period correctly", 
      arguments: [
        (AnalyticsTimePeriod.weekly, -3),
        (AnalyticsTimePeriod.monthly, -15),
        (AnalyticsTimePeriod.last3Months, -60)
      ])
func fetchAnalyticsDataTimePeriodFiltering(
  timePeriod: AnalyticsTimePeriod,
  daysOld: Int
) async throws {
  // Test implementation
}
```

### Modern Assertions
```swift
#expect(analyticsData.totalSessions == 5)
#expect(analyticsData.totalDistance > 0)
#require(try await analyticsRepository.fetchAnalyticsData(for: .monthly))
```

### Async Testing
```swift
@Test("Load analytics data correctly")
func loadAnalyticsDataCorrectly() async throws {
  await analyticsViewModel.loadAllAnalyticsData()
  #expect(analyticsViewModel.hasAnalyticsData)
}
```

### Performance Testing
```swift
@Test("Analytics calculation with 1000 sessions",
      .timeLimit(.minutes(2)))
func analyticsCalculationWith1000Sessions() async throws {
  // Performance testing implementation
}
```

### Actor-based Testing
```swift
@MainActor
struct AnalyticsViewModelTests {
  // UI-related tests
}
```
