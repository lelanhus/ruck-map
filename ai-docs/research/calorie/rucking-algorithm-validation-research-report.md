## Implications

- Current commercial fitness trackers unsuitable for precise calorie tracking with errors exceeding 25%
- LCDA represents current best practice for load carriage prediction with <1% bias when properly validated
- Thermal cardiac reactivity correction essential for heart rate-based algorithms under heat stress
- Machine learning approaches with population-specific calibration show promise for reducing errors below 20%
- Individual calibration and multi-sensor fusion necessary for acceptable accuracy levels
