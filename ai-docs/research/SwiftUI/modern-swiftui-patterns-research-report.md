# Modern SwiftUI Patterns Research Report

**Generated:** August 1, 2025  
**Sources Analyzed:** 12  
**Research Duration:** 2 hours  

## Executive Summary

- **MV Pattern Adoption**: Modern SwiftUI development is shifting from MVVM to MV (Model-View) pattern, with SwiftUI's reactive nature making ViewModels largely unnecessary for simple to medium apps
- **Swift Macros Revolution**: The @Observable macro introduced in Swift 5.9+ replaces ObservableObject, offering better performance and more granular view updates
- **Accessibility Standards**: SwiftUI provides comprehensive accessibility support through modifiers like accessibilityLabel, Dynamic Type, and VoiceOver optimization
- **Liquid Glass Introduction**: iOS 26 introduces Liquid Glass, a new adaptive material system that transforms UI elements with glass-like properties
- **Performance Focus**: Modern SwiftUI emphasizes minimizing view updates through precise state management and reactive data flow

## Key Findings

### MV (Model-View) Architecture Pattern

- **Finding:** MV pattern is emerging as the preferred architecture for SwiftUI apps over MVVM
- **Evidence:** Thomas Ricouard (IcySky, BlueSky client developer) advocates dropping MVVM entirely in SwiftUI apps. "SwiftUI views are structs, not classes. They're designed to be lightweight, disposable, and recreated frequently."

- **Finding:** MV pattern reduces boilerplate code and aligns with SwiftUI's declarative nature
- **Evidence:** With only two core components (Model and View), MV eliminates intermediary layers. SwiftUI's state-driven architecture naturally supports direct Model-View connections.

- **Finding:** MV pattern has scalability limitations for complex applications
- **Evidence:** Limited separation of concerns can lead to business logic leaking into Views. Muhammad Danish Qureshi argues: "MV may look clean in a sample app... but it won't hold up in a modular, multi-feature product."

### Swift Macros in SwiftUI

- **Finding:** @Observable macro provides significant performance improvements over ObservableObject
- **Evidence:** SwiftUI only updates views when observable properties that the view's body reads directly change, rather than updating on any property change
- **Source:** Apple Developer Documentation. "Migrating from the Observable Object protocol to the Observable macro". 2024. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro

- **Finding:** @Observable macro has critical initialization behavior differences from @StateObject
- **Evidence:** "@StateObject receives an @autoclosure for the wrappedValue parameter while @State simply receives the value. The result is that @StateObject can defer initialization and only initialize once, while @State initializes on every view rebuild."
- **Source:** Squires, Jesse. "SwiftUI's Observable macro is not a drop-in replacement for ObservableObject". September 9, 2024. https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2024/09/09/swift-observable-macro/

- **Finding:** @Observable objects should be initialized at the App level, not View level
- **Evidence:** "The correct way to architect your app is to store all (app-level or global) @State properties in your top-level App struct, which does not get repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt like SwiftUI View objects."

### SwiftUI Accessibility

- **Finding:** Dynamic Type support is automatic with system fonts but requires attention for custom fonts
- **Evidence:** SwiftUI's built-in text styles (.body, .headline, .title) automatically scale with user preferences. Custom fonts need .scaledToFill() modifier or relativeTo parameter for proper scaling.

- **Finding:** Modern accessibility requires comprehensive modifier usage
- **Evidence:** Key modifiers include accessibilityLabel (describes element), accessibilityHint (provides action context), accessibilityValue (for sliders/progress), and accessibilityHidden (to hide decorative elements)
- **Source:** Fadeeva, Natascha. "How to support Dynamic Type accessibility in SwiftUI". Tanaschita.com. June 30, 2025. https://tanaschita.com/ios-accessibility-dynamic-type/

- **Finding:** VoiceOver testing is essential for accessibility validation
- **Evidence:** "Testing your app with VoiceOver helps ensure that your app is accessible. You can enable VoiceOver in the Settings app under Accessibility."
- **Source:** Yenat. "SwiftUI Accessibility: Building Inclusive iOS Experience". Medium. May 19, 2025. https://medium.com/@yenatlij/swiftui-accessibility-building-inclusive-ios-experience-68d6c49d6ede

### Liquid Glass (iOS 26)

- **Finding:** Liquid Glass is a revolutionary new material system for iOS 26
- **Evidence:** "Liquid Glass is translucent and behaves like glass in the real world. Its color is informed by surrounding content and intelligently adapts between light and dark environments using real-time rendering."
- **Source:** Apple Inc. "Apple introduces a delightful and elegant new software design". Apple Newsroom. June 9, 2025. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/

- **Finding:** SwiftUI provides new APIs for Liquid Glass integration
- **Evidence:** New modifiers include .glassEffect(), .glassEffectContainer, .tabBarMinimizeBehavior, and .backgroundExtensionEffect for adopting Liquid Glass design
- **Source:** Apple Developer. "Build a SwiftUI app with the new design - WWDC25". 2025. https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/323/

- **Finding:** Liquid Glass transforms standard controls and navigation elements
- **Evidence:** "Controls like toggles, segmented pickers, and sliders now transform into liquid glass during interaction, creating a delightful experience!"

## Data Analysis

| Pattern/Technology | Adoption Recommendation | Complexity Level | Performance Impact |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| MV Pattern | High for simple-medium apps | Low | Positive |
| MVVM Pattern | Medium for complex apps | Medium-High | Neutral |
| @Observable Macro | High (iOS 17+) | Low-Medium | Very Positive |
| ObservableObject | Legacy (maintain existing) | Medium | Neutral |
| Dynamic Type | Essential | Low | Minimal |
| VoiceOver Support | Essential | Medium | Minimal |
| Liquid Glass | High (iOS 26+) | Medium | Positive |

## Implications

- **Architecture Shift**: SwiftUI development is moving toward simplified architectures that leverage the framework's reactive nature
- **Performance Optimization**: @Observable macro provides measurable performance improvements through granular view updates
- **Accessibility Mandate**: Modern SwiftUI development must prioritize accessibility from the start, not as an afterthought
- **Design Evolution**: Liquid Glass represents Apple's vision for the future of UI design, requiring developers to adopt new patterns
- **Education Gap**: Many developers still apply UIKit patterns to SwiftUI, creating unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Recommendations

### For Ruck Tracking Application

1. **Architecture**: Adopt MV pattern for the initial implementation, with potential MVVM migration for complex features
2. **State Management**: Use @Observable for iOS 17+ targets, ensuring proper initialization at App level
3. **Accessibility**: Implement comprehensive accessibility support including:
   - Dynamic Type for all text elements
   - Proper accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint usage
   - VoiceOver testing throughout development
4. **Future-Proofing**: Prepare for Liquid Glass adoption with iOS 26 compatibility in mind

### Code Examples

#### MV Pattern Implementation
```swift
@Observable
class RuckingSessionModel {
    var distance: Double = 0.0
    var duration: TimeInterval = 0
    var isActive: Bool = false
    
    func startSession() {
        isActive = true
        // Business logic here
    }
}

struct RuckingView: View {
    @State private var session = RuckingSessionModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Distance: \(session.distance, specifier: "%.2f") miles")
                .font(.title2)
                .accessibilityLabel("Current distance: \(session.distance, specifier: "%.2f") miles")
            
            Button(session.isActive ? "Stop" : "Start") {
                if session.isActive {
                    session.stopSession()
                } else {
                    session.startSession()
                }
            }
            .accessibilityHint(session.isActive ? "Stop the rucking session" : "Start a new rucking session")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Accessibility Implementation
```swift
struct ProgressView: View {
    let progress: Double
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ProgressView(value: progress)
                .accessibilityLabel("Session progress")
                .accessibilityValue("\(Int(progress * 100)) percent complete")
            
            Text("Progress: \(progress * 100, specifier: "%.0f")%")
                .font(.body)
                .accessibilityHidden(true) // Avoid duplicate information
        }
    }
}
```
