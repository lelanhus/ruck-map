- **Features**:
  - Critical weather warnings (extreme temperature, high winds, heavy precipitation)
  - Expandable alert cards with detailed information
  - Safety recommendations for critical conditions
  - Compact banner mode for status display
  - Auto-expiring alerts with timestamp information
- **Severity Levels**: Info, Warning, Critical with appropriate styling

### 4. Army Green Color Theme (`/RuckMap/Core/UI/Theme/Colors.swift`)
- **Purpose**: Unified color system for weather components
- **Features**:
  - Temperature-based color mapping (cold to hot spectrum)
  - Weather impact level colors (beneficial to dangerous)
  - Alert severity colors with accessibility support
  - iOS 26 Liquid Glass preparation with transparency effects
  - High contrast variants for accessibility
- **Future Ready**: Prepared for Liquid Glass design system

## Integration Points

### 1. ActiveTrackingView Integration
- **Location**: Integrated weather card in main metrics section
- **Features**:
  - Compact weather display during active tracking
  - Real-time weather impact on calorie display
  - Weather alerts in status header
  - Temperature, humidity, and wind information
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on tracking performance

### 2. SessionDetailView Integration
- **Location**: Weather summary section in session details
- **Features**:
  - Historical weather conditions during the ruck
  - Weather impact analysis on calories burned
  - Temperature, humidity, wind conditions
  - Formatted time display for weather data
- **Data Persistence**: Weather conditions saved with session data

### 3. LocationTrackingManager Integration
- **Weather Service**: Integrated with existing WeatherService
- **Real-time Updates**: Weather data updates during tracking
- **Alert Generation**: Automatic weather alerts for dangerous conditions
- **Calorie Impact**: Weather factors applied to calorie calculations

## Technical Architecture

### Modern SwiftUI Patterns
- **@Observable**: Uses iOS 17+ @Observable macro instead of ObservableObject
- **ViewBuilder**: Custom view modifiers for reusable components
- **Environment**: Proper environment value propagation
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions with SwiftUI animation system

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient view rendering for weather data
- **Caching**: Weather data caching to reduce API calls
- **Battery Optimization**: Configurable update frequencies
- **Background Processing**: Proper background task management

### Accessibility Features
- **VoiceOver Support**: Comprehensive screen reader support
- **Dynamic Type**: Respects user text size preferences
- **High Contrast**: Support for accessibility display modes
- **Semantic Labels**: Descriptive accessibility labels and hints

## Weather Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: WeatherService fetches data from Apple WeatherKit
2. **Processing**: WeatherConditions model stores and processes weather data
3. **Analysis**: WeatherImpactAnalysis calculates safety and calorie impacts
4. **Display**: WeatherDisplayView presents information with appropriate styling
5. **Alerts**: WeatherAlertView shows safety warnings when needed
6. **Settings**: WeatherSettingsView allows user customization

## Testing Implementation

### Swift Testing Framework Tests
- **WeatherDisplayViewTests**: Component behavior and UI logic
- **WeatherIntegrationTests**: End-to-end weather functionality
- **WeatherThemeIntegrationTests**: Color system and theming
- **Performance Tests**: Battery usage and update frequency validation

### Test Coverage
- Weather condition processing and validation
- Temperature color mapping and impact calculations
- Alert generation for dangerous conditions
- UI component initialization and data binding
- Integration with LocationTrackingManager
- Battery optimization scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### iOS 26 Preparation
- **Liquid Glass Effects**: Semi-transparent backgrounds ready for implementation
- **Dynamic Island**: Weather alerts can be extended to Dynamic Island
- **App Intents**: Weather data exposure for Siri and Shortcuts
- **Live Activities**: Real-time weather updates in Live Activities

### Additional Features
- **Weather Radar**: Integration with weather radar data
- **Forecast Integration**: Multi-day weather planning
- **Route Weather**: Weather conditions along planned routes
- **Historical Analysis**: Weather pattern analysis over time

## Installation Notes

The weather components are designed as modular SwiftUI views that integrate seamlessly with the existing RuckMap architecture. Key integration points:

1. **Inline Implementation**: Components are implemented inline in ActiveTrackingView and SessionDetailView to avoid Xcode project configuration issues
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful degradation when weather data is unavailable
3. **Performance Impact**: Minimal impact on location tracking and battery life
4. **User Control**: Full user control over weather features through settings

## Usage Examples

### Basic Weather Display
```swift
// Compact weather card during tracking
WeatherCard(
    conditions: weatherConditions,
    showCalorieImpact: true
)

// Detailed weather in session summary
weatherSummarySection(weatherConditions)
```

### Weather Settings Integration
```swift
@AppStorage("showCalorieImpact") private var showCalorieImpact = true
@AppStorage("weatherUpdateFrequency") private var updateFrequency = WeatherUpdateFrequency.balanced.rawValue
```

### Alert Handling
```swift
// Display weather alerts in status bar
ForEach(locationManager.weatherAlerts, id: \.title) { alert in
    WeatherAlertBanner(alert: alert)
}
```

This implementation provides a comprehensive weather information system that enhances safety, improves calorie calculation accuracy, and follows modern iOS design principles while maintaining the RuckMap army green aesthetic.
