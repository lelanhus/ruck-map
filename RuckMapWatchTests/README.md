# RuckMap Watch Tests

Comprehensive test suite for the RuckMap Watch app implementation using Swift Testing framework.

## Test Overview

This test suite provides complete coverage for the Watch app's core business logic, data management, and integration scenarios. All tests use Swift Testing's modern `@Test` and `#expect` syntax with proper async/await support.

## Mock Strategy

The test suite uses comprehensive mocking for external dependencies:

- **MockCLLocationManager**: Simulates GPS location updates and authorization
- **MockWatchDataManager**: Controls storage operations and error injection
- **MockWatchHealthKitManager**: Simulates HealthKit authorization and data
- **MockHKHealthStore**: Tests HealthKit query and sample management

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using Xcode's test navigator or command line:

```bash
# Run all Watch tests
xcodebuild test -scheme RuckMapWatch -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm)'

# Run specific test suite
xcodebuild test -scheme RuckMapWatch -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm)' -only-testing:RuckMapWatchTests/WatchLocationManagerTests
```

## Test Data Generators

The test suite includes comprehensive test data generators:

- `createTestLocation()`: GPS locations with configurable parameters
- `createTestWorkoutRoute()`: Multi-point routes for distance testing
- `createVariedTerrainRoute()`: Routes with elevation changes for grade testing
- `createExtendedWorkoutRoute()`: Long routes for performance testing

## Assertion Patterns

Tests follow Swift Testing best practices:

- Use `#expect()` for non-fatal assertions with descriptive messages
- Use `#require()` for critical preconditions that must pass
- Parameterized tests with `@Test(arguments:)` for comprehensive coverage
- Async/await support for testing concurrent operations
- Proper error testing with `#expect(throws:)` and `do/catch`

## Coverage Goals

- **Business Logic**: 95%+ coverage of all calculation and state management
- **Data Layer**: 90%+ coverage of storage and retrieval operations  
- **Integration**: 85%+ coverage of component interactions
- **Error Paths**: 80%+ coverage of error handling scenarios

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run reliably in CI environments:

- No external network dependencies
- Deterministic test data and timing
- Proper cleanup of resources and state
- Fast execution with focused unit tests
- Integration tests that simulate real usage patterns

## Future Enhancements
