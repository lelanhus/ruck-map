**Memory Usage: Efficient management**
- ✅ Large routes (10K+ points) optimized to <50MB
- ✅ Memory optimization preserves route quality
- ✅ Long sessions managed with point limiting

**Battery Optimization: <5% additional drain**
- ✅ Update frequency adapts to battery level
- ✅ Detail level reduces on low battery
- ✅ Stationary optimization reduces power usage

**Polyline Performance:**
- ✅ Route optimization completes in <0.5s for 10K points
- ✅ Distance accuracy preserved within 5%
- ✅ Start/end points exactly maintained

### ✅ 5. Accessibility Testing

**VoiceOver Navigation:**
- ✅ Current location marker has descriptive labels
- ✅ Route markers include proper accessibility traits
- ✅ Mile markers provide distance context
- ✅ Terrain overlays describe surface impact

**Map Controls:**
- ✅ Center location button accessible
- ✅ Map style controls have clear labels
- ✅ Terrain toggle provides feedback
- ✅ Tab navigation maintains VoiceOver context

**Dynamic Content:**
- ✅ GPS status changes announced
- ✅ Route progress updates accessible
- ✅ Weather information clearly described
- ✅ Alerts and warnings properly announced

### ✅ 6. Swift Testing Framework Implementation

**Modern Testing Patterns Used:**
- ✅ @Test annotations throughout
- ✅ #expect assertions (non-fatal)
- ✅ #require for critical preconditions
- ✅ Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- ✅ Async testing with proper await patterns
- ✅ @MainActor compliance for UI tests
- ✅ .timeLimit() for performance requirements
- ✅ Custom test suites with @Suite

**Migration from XCTest:**
- ✅ All new tests use Swift Testing syntax
- ✅ Existing tests already converted to Swift Testing
- ✅ No XCTest deprecation warnings
