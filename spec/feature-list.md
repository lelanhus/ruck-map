# RuckMap Feature List

## MVP Features (Launch Requirements)

### 1. Core Ruck Logging
**Description**: Essential tracking functionality for recording ruck sessions

#### Features:
- **Start/Stop/Pause** ruck session tracking
- **Real-time metrics display**:
  - Distance (GPS-based)
  - Duration/Time
  - Current pace
  - Average pace
  - Elevation gain/loss
  - Calories burned (advanced algorithm)
  - Work performed (joules/watts)
- **Load weight input** (manual entry)
- **Route tracking** with GPS breadcrumb trail
- **Weather conditions** (automatic via WeatherKit)
- **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)** post-ruck rating

#### Outstanding Questions:
- Should we allow mid-ruck weight adjustments (e.g., dropping/adding weight)?
- How detailed should weather tracking be (just conditions or include wind/humidity)?
- Should RPE be collected during or only after the ruck?

#### Recommendations:
- **Mid-ruck weight adjustments**: Yes - support weight changes with quick adjustment button and auto-prompt during extended pauses. Track as timeline events for accuracy.
- **Weather tracking**: Comprehensive - track wind speed/direction and humidity for algorithm accuracy. Display simplified view but store detailed data.
- **RPE collection**: Both - optional mid-ruck checks every 30 min via watch haptics, mandatory post-ruck overall rating.

### 2. Advanced Calorie Algorithm
**Description**: Military-grade calorie calculation with sensor fusion

#### Features:
- **LCDA base algorithm** implementation
- **GPS + Barometer fusion** for accurate elevation
- **Terrain detection** (basic 4 types: pavement, trail, sand, snow)
- **Grade/incline calculations**
- **Real-time calorie burn rate**
- **Total calories with confidence intervals**

#### Outstanding Questions:
- Should we display algorithm confidence/accuracy to users?
- How to handle manual terrain override?
- Should we show calorie breakdown by segment?

#### Recommendations:
- **Algorithm confidence display**: Yes for power users - show as optional "precision mode" with confidence intervals (e.g., "325 Â± 15 cal"). Builds trust and differentiates us.
- **Manual terrain override**: Long-press on terrain indicator to override with haptic confirmation. Auto-revert after 5 minutes unless re-confirmed.
- **Calorie breakdown by segment**: Yes in post-ruck analysis - show splits with terrain/grade impact. Real-time option for advanced users.

- Which metrics are most important to highlight?
- Should we include goal setting in MVP?

#### Recommendations:
- **Time periods**: Default to 7/30/All with easy toggle. Power users can unlock 90/180/365 day views. Focus on recent performance for engagement.
- **Priority metrics**: Weekly distance, average load weight, total elevation, calorie accuracy trend. Show "improvement badges" for PRs.
